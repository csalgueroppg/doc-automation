/**
 * Contains shared model classes used across the application for representing
 * generic outcomes and validation results.
 * <p>
 * This package includes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.ppg.iicsdoc.model.common.Result} — a generic wrapper for success/failure responses with optional data and error metadata</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.ppg.iicsdoc.model.common.ValidationResult} — a structured representation of validation outcomes, including errors and warnings</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These models promote consistency in service-layer and API responses, and are
 * designed to be reusable across modules and layers of the application.
