/**
 * Contains core data models used throughout the application.
 * <p>
 * This package is divided into submodules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code model.common} — shared utility models such as {@link com.example.model.common.Result} and {@link com.example.model.common.ValidationResult}</li>
 *   <li>{@code model.domain} — domain-specific entities that represent the core business logic and data structures</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These models are designed to be serializable, reusable, and consistent across service, controller, and persistence layers.
